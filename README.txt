DESCRIPTION
-----------
This collects together any code relating to analysis of running/cycling/exercise etc.

Current subprojects:
Activity record analysis - used to process and analyse data from my activity_record spreadsheet.
OCT pacing analysis - to process and analyse Old County Tops results to work out pace charts.
Race result analysis - used to process my race results.

Each of these were also used as examples to learn about data processing.
There are some Rmd notes on OCT in the OCT folder on dropbox.
